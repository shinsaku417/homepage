          Homeless Pony is a puzzle game that won the <b>3rd Place Award</b> at <b>2014 MakeGamesWithus iOS Game Development Competition</b>.
          In this game, you jump in an L-shape like a knight in chess,
        and your goal is to collect every single carrot on the map, then get to the goal square. In
        addition, you cannot step on the same square twice because if you do, an activated trap will
        catch you.

          Tap Pro S is a highscore-based iOS tapping game that challenges your reaction and tapping speed.
          Your goal is to get a highscore by tapping on the side that says "Tap" (left when background is white, right when background is black).
          You build up a combo by continuously tapping on the correct side, but you lose your combo when you tap on the wrong side.
          You have 30 seconds, and background color changes 25% of the time every second (10 sec or less left, every 0.5 second). Coming
          soon on the App Store.

          Robot War AI Programming Competition is a pair-programming competition held at MGWU Summer Academy, where AIs that MGWU students
          built compete against each other in a <a href = https://www.makegameswith.us/tutorials/sandbox/robot-wars-with-git/ target = "_blank">game</a> created by MGWU staffs. After battling through tough oppositions, <b>ShingekiNoKyojin9</b> (shout out to all Attack on Titan fans), built by my talented partner and I, won the competition. Aside from incorporating in-range search from an example code, our AI had following features that enabled us to win:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Out-of-range search using trigonometry, utilizing position information from a bullet that hit an enemy</li>
          <li>Randomized initial positioning to one of the corners</li>
          <li>0-90 degrees shooting from a corner
          <li>Escape mechanics when in a disadvantageous position</li>
        </ul>

          Chess is one of my biggest hobbies. I became youngest ever National Chess Champion of
          Japan (16 years, 18 days old) in 2007, represented Japan at 38th Chess Olympiad in 2008,
          and won the U.S. National High School Chess Championship in 2010.

          Let me talk a little about myself. I was born in Japan, and came to the United States when I was 8. Soon after I came to the States, my dad introduced me to chess. I got 3rd place in my first chess tournament at the chess club, and since then, I have 7 national titles under my belt. I am also a badminton player. I joined Cal Badminton Club in my freshman year, which has the strongest collegiate badminton team in the nation. Being a complete beginner, I didn't even have my own racket. However, through insane training that mounted up to 30 hours a week, I was able to make the tryouts in my junior year. One of my characteristics is that if I am passionate about something, I would not hesitate to spend my entire day committing to it.<br><br>

Now, let me talk to you about my programming background. I was first introduced to programming in high school, when I took an advanced computer science class. Although I was not the best, or even top 10 in the class, I intended to major in computer science at UC Berkeley. When I took my first CS course at Cal, I got a B-. When I took another CS course, I failed. This was enough for me to believe that computer science was not for me. After all, I ended up double majoring in cognitive science and linguistics.<br><br>

When I was about to graduate, I had no idea what to do with my life. I was not as passionate in cognitive science nor in linguistics to go to graduate school in these fields (plus, I was not confident to do well in GRE), and I could not imagine myself getting a job. It was almost impossible for me to even write a resume because I did not accomplish anything remarkable academically at college.<br><br>

Five days before the commencement, I received a facebook message from my brother, asking whether I would like to participate in MGWU Summer Academy. He also said that MGWU Summer Academy would be more practical than theoretical, and I would enjoy making a game. I said yes to the offer, since I had nothing better to do after graduation.<br><br>

Having very little programming experience and being surrounded by talented programmers, I had a tough time during 1st week of the academy. However, when I was introduced to robot wars AI programming at the start of 2nd week, I soon became interested in building an AI. Aside from working 9am-5pm at MGWU, I found myself spending majority of the time at home implementing new features to our AI.  This is also the time when I learned a very valuable lesson from my brother, who works as a programmer. When he walked by hearing me complain about errors, he told me that I should be willing to print out everything that I don't know of via NSLog. Since then, I always tried to debug myself, and as a result, I became one of the students who asked least coding questions during the academy.<br><br>

After winning the AI tournament, we started making our own games. I had very little trouble making my game because I already knew how to debug, which allowed me to work more on creating levels (since my game is a puzzle game) and polishing, rather than spending too much time developing game mechanics. And on the Demo day, my game “Homeless Pony” won the 3rd place award among students from Palo Alto and San Francisco. I was definitely inexperienced than most of the students at the academy, but with the amount of work that I put in, I was able to outperform people with more experience.<br><br>

I would like to thank MGWU for helping me to realize that I am very passionate about building things, whether it is a game or an AI. After the academy, I built and shipped 4 simple games in a week, and soon, they are going to be on the App Store. In the near future, I hope to get a job where I can build remarkable things that people want, or attend another programming bootcamp to further strengthen my programming skills.<br><br>
